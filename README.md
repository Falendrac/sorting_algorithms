# sorting_algorithms

Project in collaboration with Charlotte Fournier.
We see how to do Big O and do better algorithm's

## General

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
